# HTML part
For this part of the course work, I created a simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript website for an Uzbek national footbal club 'Paxtakor'. The website consists of six pages with each page having its own styles, the same header section and a footer part. The first page is the main page in which a quick overview of the website is intended to be reflected. Each page has several hyperlinks in both navigation and footer section in order for a user easily and quickly navigate between the pages.
The second of the website is 'About' page, in which a user can get familiar with FC's most famous players.
The third page is called 'Shop' which is an online commerce for selling FC's clothes and accessories.
The next page is 'Award' page. It mainly shows several cups and tromphies the team has won up to the day.
The fifth page is 'Contact' which is intended for improving a virtual relationship between the team and viewers.
The last page is 'Sign up' page where a user can sign up for a website to stay up to date of the latest changes and upgrades in the team's activity.

# CSS part 
Each page has its own unique styles. Buttons in all pages have a gradient feature. Hovers are mostly used in the main and contact pages. 

# JavaScript 
JavaScript is only in the last of the website 'Sign up' page. Only in one page, a user can both sign up and sign in for a website just by clicking on the button that transforms the page from the sign up to sign
